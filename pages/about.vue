        Just like our regular currency, crypto is another currency but a virtual
        and digital one which can be used by individuals or organizations.
        Unlike our regular currencies, cryptos are decentralized and allow users
        to make secure financial transactions while shielding their identity.
        The first of this currency is bitcoin which was created by Satoshi
        Nakamoto in 2009, presently there are thousands of alternative coins
        which can also be used for transactions just like bitcoins.
